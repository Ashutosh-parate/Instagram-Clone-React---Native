## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: Framework for building native apps using React

- **React Navigation**: Navigation library for React Native
- **Formik**: Form management library

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-clone.git
   cd instagram-clone
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have `npm` or `yarn` installed. Then run:

   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**

   - Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable **Email/Password** authentication in the Authentication section.
   - Set up Firestore as the database.
   - Create a `firebaseConfig.js` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase project configuration:

     ```js
     // firebaseConfig.js
     import firebase from 'firebase/app';
     import 'firebase/auth';
     import 'firebase/firestore';

     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     };

     if (!firebase.apps.length) {
       firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
     }

     export { firebase };
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```sh
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server. You can then use the Expo app on your phone or an emulator to run the app.

   Open the app and sign up for a new account or log in with an existing account.

2. **Create a Post**

   - Click `Post` to upload the image.

3. **Like and Comment**

4. **Follow Users**
